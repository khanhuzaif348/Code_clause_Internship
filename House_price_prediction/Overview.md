- **Project Title:** Predicting House Prices  
- **Internship Domain:** Data Science Intern  
- **Project Level:** Entry Level  
- **Assigned By:** CodeClause Internship  
- **Assigned To:** Mohd Huzaif  
- **Start Date:** 01 Feb 2025

## Aim
Build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms and square footage.

## Description
This project involves using a dataset of house prices, splitting it into training and testing sets, and building a regression model using Scikit-learn. The model predicts house prices based on independent features such as the number of bedrooms and square footage.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## What You Will Learn
- Introduction to regression modeling and prediction
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training, evaluation, and interpretation
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted values

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khanhuzaif348/Code_clause_Internship/edit/main/House_price_prediction
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

### Predicting House Prices
You can modify the script to predict house prices for custom inputs:
```python
predicted_price = predict_price(2500, 3)
print(f"Predicted Price: ${predicted_price:.2f}")
```

## Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared Score (RÂ²)
- Model Coefficients and Intercept
